# Classical RS Error Correction

In classical RS error correction, we apply the arithmetic logic of $$GF(2^m)$$ to extract the polynomial from our input message.
For example, $$GF(8)$$ is a field with elements $${0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}$$ each representing a polynomial of degree and operations similar to polynomials with
f(x)=m0+m1*x+m2*x^2+m3
